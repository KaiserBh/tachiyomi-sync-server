## Installation

<!-- Full installation guide and documentation can be found at https://syncyomi.com -->

Head to [releases](https://github.com/SyncYomi/SyncYomi/releases) and download the binary for your operating system. Then, run the binary.


### Docker compose

docker-compose for syncyomi. Modify accordingly if running with unRAID or setting up with Portainer.

* Logging is optional
* Host port mapping might need to be changed to not collide with other apps
* Change `BASE_DOCKER_DATA_PATH` to match your setup. Can be simply `./data`
* Set custom network if needed
* You may need to update the host address to 0.0.0.0 if you are running with podman

Create `docker-compose.yml` and add the following. If you have a existing setup change to fit that.

```yml
version: "3.9"

services:
  syncyomi:
    container_name: syncyomi
    image: ghcr.io/syncyomi/syncyomi:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      - TZ=${TZ}
    user: 1000:1000
    volumes:
      - ${BASE_DOCKER_DATA_PATH}/syncyomi/config:/config
    ports:
      - 8282:8282
```

Then start with

    docker compose up -d

### Windows
Download the latest release and run it.

<!-- Check the windows setup guide [here](https://syncyomi.com/installation/windows) -->

### Linux generic


Download the latest release, or download the [source code](https://github.com/SyncYomi/SyncYomi/releases/latest) and build it yourself using `make build`.

```bash
wget $(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/SyncYomi/SyncYomi/releases/latest | grep download | grep linux_x86_64 | cut -d\" -f4)
```

#### Systemd (Recommended)

On Linux-based systems, it's recommended to run SyncYomi as a service with auto-restarting capabilities to ensure minimal downtime. The most common approach is to use systemd.

You will need to create a service file in `/etc/systemd/system/` called `syncyomi.service`.

```bash
touch /etc/systemd/system/syncyomi@.service
```

Then place the following content inside the file (e.g. via nano/vim/ed):

```prolog
[Unit]
Description=SyncYomi service for %i
After=syslog.target network-online.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=%i
Group=%i
ExecStart=/usr/bin/syncyomi --config=/home/%i/.config/syncyomi/

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Start the service. Enable will make it startup on reboot.

```bash
systemctl enable -q --now --user syncyomi@$USER
```

By default, the configuration is set to listen on `127.0.0.1`. It is highly recommended to use a reverse proxy like caddy, nginx or traefik.

If you are not running a reverse proxy change `host` in the `config.toml` to `0.0.0.0`.

## Usage
### Configuring and Running the Service
### Initial Setup
After the first run of the SyncYomi service, several files will be generated in your specified running directory. These are essential for the service's operation.

#### Configuration for Reverse Proxy Users
If you're using a reverse proxy and your setup includes a sub-directory, it's crucial to update the baseUrl value in your configuration. Additionally, adjust your proxy settings to exclude this suffix. Below is an example configuration for nginx:

```nginx
location /syncyomi/ {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:8282/;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection $http_connection;
}
```
After updating the configuration file, restart the SyncYomi service to apply these changes.

#### API Key Generation
To generate an API key, access the web interface of SyncYomi at `http://<your-server-address>:8282`.
Once the service is running, navigate to `Settings > API` Keys and create a new API key. This key is crucial for linking your Tachiyomi clients to the SyncYomi service.

## Install The App
#### Preparing for Installation
Before proceeding, backup your existing Tachiyomi environment. The latest release of the modified Tachiyomi app can be found on our Discord channel.

Install the modified Tachiyomi client on your device. Then, go to `Settings > Data and Storage` in the app. Under the Sync section, input your Host details (e.g., `http://192.168.1.202:8282` or `https://sync.mydomain.tld`) and the previously generated API Key.

### Synchronization Details
Currently, synchronization occurs at fixed intervals. 
If you frequently switch between devices, manually initiate a sync in the `Data and Storage` settings of the Tachiyomi app on the device you were using. 
Repeat this process on the next device after the first synchronization is complete to ensure your reading progress is up-to-date across all devices.
